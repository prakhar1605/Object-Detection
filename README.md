**Overview**

 **Real-Time Object Detection with YOLO** 
  
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model with OpenCV and a webcam feed. The model detects and classifies objects such as people, cars, and animals from live video input.

**Features**

Uses a pre-trained YOLOv3 model to detect objects.

Real-time object detection through a webcam.

Draws bounding boxes and labels detected objects.

Implements confidence thresholding and non-maxima suppression.

**Requirements**

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Additionally, download the YOLOv3 model files:

YOLOv3 weights

YOLOv3 config

COCO class names

Place these files in the project directory.

**Usage**

Clone the repository:

Run the Python script:

Press q to exit the live detection.

File Structure

Output Example

The program will display a live video feed with detected objects labeled and bounded.
